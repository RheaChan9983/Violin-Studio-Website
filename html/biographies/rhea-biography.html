                <p>To Rhea, teaching music is a way to share her love and passion of music to those who choose to learn the violin.
                Music has been an amazing part of her life and has given her so many opportunities to meet some amazing people and friends
                and has open so many doors. She hopes to pass this on and share this with her students.</p>
